Tony Gonzales (R-Texas). The numbers were breathtaking: 13,376 convicted murderers, 16,120 convicted of sexual assault, 64,579 convicted of assault, 43,546 convicted of burglary, larceny or robbery, 13,876 convicted of weapons offenses, 2,606 convicted of kidnapping and 2,218 convicted of commercialized sexual offenses — all before they ever came to America and were released into the country by the federal government. According to the House Homeland Security Committee release on Sept. 27, “they had previously been encountered by CBP, turned over to ICE, had their criminal history documented, and then were released into the United States.” The vast majority of these convicted criminals — 151,851 out of 156,521, or 97 percent — were not currently detained by ICE, with only 4,670 are detention and subject to removal. Of the convicted murderers, the numbers are even worse: only 277 are in detention, or just 2.2 percent. The rest are apparently just roaming around. But now Harris is promising that when she is in office — apparently heedless that she has already been in office for almost four years — to complete her border visit checkbox photo opportunity, posted on X on Sept. 29, “As president, I will secure our border, disrupt the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States, and work to fix our broken system of immigration.” But one of the things “broken” is the Biden-Harris administration’s propensity to release convicted criminals into the U.S., simply out of incompetence or worse, on purpose. 156,521 out of 8.3 million who have crossed the border since 2021, that’s a 1.87 percent violent crime rate, almost 2 out of every 100 let into the country, are convicted, violent criminals. Compare that to the national violent crime rate, which includes murder, manslaughter, rape and robbery, of 0.36 percent, or 363.8 out of every 100,000 — that’s five times the national violent crime rate. Perhaps Kamala Harris does not need to visit the southern border to find out why this is happening, but by visiting the Oval Office, the Department of Homeland Security and by looking in the mirror.

If we haven't met yet, I'd love to introduce myself. I married the love of my life, Lindsay, in 2014 and we are raising our two boys, Charles Willis and Beecher, in my hometown of McDonough. I was first elected to the State House in 2012, and I served in the House until I ran for State Senate in 2017. I have served in the Senate since January of 2018 and currently serve as the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I am a partner at Smith, Welch, Webb, and White and manage a general litigation law practice. Our family attends McDonough Presbyterian Church, and we are involved in many other community organizations.

If you have any specific questions for me, please feel free to send me a DM.

791381476229910,18079407397,CPAC,2024-08-16,2024-08-16,2024-08-23,AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION,"Frank Russo, Director of the CPAC Foundation’s Center for Combating Human Trafficking, recently shared testimony with Ranking Member Senator Chuck Grassley of the Budget Committee on the crisis involving unaccompanied minors in America. Our testimony raised awareness about the systemic failures within the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) and the devastating impact these shortcomings have on vulnerable children. 

Specifically, we brought attention to the significant shortcomings of the current administration's border policies, which have inadvertently facilitated the trafficking of thousands of children across state lines. With approximately 370,000 unaccompanied alien children crossing the southern border under the Biden administration, and studies indicating that 60% of these children fall into the hands of cartels, it is imperative to address the lack of adequate oversight and enforcement. The misuse of government benefits by traffickers and the ORR's inadequate vetting of guardians further exacerbate the crisis.

We are grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with Senator Grassley and other members of Congress committed to combating human trafficking. The submission of this testimony is a testament to our unwavering dedication to protecting the most vulnerable among us and our resolve to drive meaningful change. We believe that with increased awareness and legislative support, we can make significant strides in ending child trafficking and holding those who exploit our immigration system accountable. This testimony is not just a call to action; it is a call to uphold the values of justice, safety, and dignity for all children.

Hispanic voters are quickly becoming a deciding voting block in national elections. Over 36 million eligible voters are Hispanic, and according to Pew Research, they are the second fastest growing racial and ethnic group in the United States electorate. They are not a group to be overlooked or taken for granted. 

Yet, for decades, the Democrat Party has done just that, claiming to represent them only to offer empty promises and champion policies contrary to their values. 

Under President Trump, winds shifted. Hispanic communities thrived under the Trump economy, especially Hispanic women. More Latinas opened businesses than men during the Trump era in addition to low unemployment numbers. 

The pro-life, pro-family, and pro-faith policies on social issues aligned with their family- and faith-oriented values. 

The Left has long thought they just needed a liberal immigration policy to secure the Hispanic vote, but Trump’s presidency demonstrated that the Hispanic community has more concerns than just immigration.  They care about education, the economy, and community safety, all issues Kamala Harris and the Biden administration are working to undermine with radical transgender ideology, reckless economic policies, and their open border agenda. 

Hispanic women especially care about these issues. As the heart of their families, they play an active role in the raising and education of their children and often make household financial decisions. 

The indoctrination of children in schools and the rampant inflation of the Biden administration contradicts the values of freedom, faith, and hard work they want to instill in the next generation. 

Latinas for Freedom, a joint initiative between CPAC Unidos and Bienvenido Action PAC, is giving a voice to Hispanic women and Hispanic voters at large who want to see change from the Biden-Harris administration. 

Latinas for Freedom is reaching thousands of voters in major swing states like Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, and more through social media outreach, advertising, and roundtables and rallies with major speakers and...Continue reading at CPAC.org/blog.",,www.instagram.com,,"lower_bound: 2000, upper_bound: 2999","lower_bound: 0, upper_bound: 99",USD,"{""age"":""65+"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.030597},{""age"":""25-34"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.071394},{""age"":""55-64"",""gender"":""unknown"",""percentage"":0.001943},{""age"":""18-24"",""gender"":""unknown"",""percentage"":0.007285},{""age"":""65+"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.052453},{""age"":""45-54"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.049539},{""age"":""35-44"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.073822},{""age"":""25-34"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.11899},{""age"":""18-24"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.084507},{""age"":""45-54"",""gender"":""unknown"",""percentage"":0.001943},{""age"":""55-64"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.075765},{""age"":""18-24"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.243808},{""age"":""35-44"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.067508},{""age"":""55-64"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.044196},{""age"":""25-34"",""gender"":""unknown"",""percentage"":0.005342},{""age"":""45-54"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.066051},{""age"":""35-44"",""gender"":""unknown"",""percentage"":0.0034},{""age"":""65+"",""gender"":""unknown"",""percentage"":0.001457}","{""region"":""Alaska"",""percentage"":0.000969},{""region"":""Tennessee"",""percentage"":0.020359},{""region"":""New Jersey"",""percentage"":0.031992},{""region"":""New Mexico"",""percentage"":0.003878},{""region"":""New York"",""percentage"":0.117305},{""region"":""North Carolina"",""percentage"":0.028599},{""region"":""Ohio"",""percentage"":0.024237},{""region"":""Oklahoma"",""percentage"":0.004847},{""region"":""Oregon"",""percentage"":0.012603},{""region"":""Pennsylvania"",""percentage"":0.033446},{""region"":""Rhode Island"",""percentage"":0.005332},{""region"":""South Carolina"",""percentage"":0.008725},{""region"":""Texas"",""percentage"":0.0984},{""region"":""Nebraska"",""percentage"":0.003393},{""region"":""Utah"",""percentage"":0.00824},{""region"":""Virginia"",""percentage"":0.024237},{""region"":""Washington"",""percentage"":0.019874},{""region"":""West Virginia"",""percentage"":0.001939},{""region"":""Wisconsin"",""percentage"":0.009695},{""region"":""Washington, District of Columbia"",""percentage"":0.001454},{""region"":""Maine"",""percentage"":0.001939},{""region"":""Montana"",""percentage"":0.002424},{""region"":""New Hampshire"",""percentage"":0.001939},{""region"":""North Dakota"",""percentage"":0.000485},{""region"":""Nevada"",""percentage"":0.008725},{""region"":""Missouri"",""percentage"":0.013088},{""region"":""Vermont"",""percentage"":0.000969},{""region"":""Hawaii"",""percentage"":0.005332},{""region"":""Wyoming"",""percentage"":0.000969},{""region"":""Alabama"",""percentage"":0.00824},{""region"":""Arizona"",""percentage"":0.01842},{""region"":""Arkansas"",""percentage"":0.007271},{""region"":""California"",""percentage"":0.181774},{""region"":""Colorado"",""percentage"":0.011634},{""region"":""Connecticut"",""percentage"":0.013572},{""region"":""Delaware"",""percentage"":0.001939},{""region"":""Florida"",""percentage"":0.091614},{""region"":""Georgia"",""percentage"":0.025691},{""region"":""Idaho"",""percentage"":0.004363},{""region"":""Mississippi"",""percentage"":0.005332},{""region"":""Illinois"",""percentage"":0.022782},{""region"":""Indiana"",""percentage"":0.013088},{""region"":""Iowa"",""percentage"":0.003393},{""region"":""Kansas"",""percentage"":0.003878},{""region"":""Kentucky"",""percentage"":0.011149},{""region"":""Louisiana"",""percentage"":0.01842},{""region"":""Maryland"",""percentage"":0.014057},{""region"":""Massachusetts"",""percentage"":0.022298},{""region"":""Michigan"",""percentage"":0.012603},{""region"":""Minnesota"",""percentage"":0.011634},{""region"":""South Dakota"",""percentage"":0.001454}",instagram,lower_bound: 1000001,en,2024-09-23,2024-09-23,2024-09-30,0.362798

Within one year, President Trump had already cut taxes, deregulated industry, reopened the oil, coal, and gas industries, and improved foreign trade deals, together creating a thriving economy and environment where everyday Americans and small business owners could prosper. 

Trump’s deregulation initiatives especially won the support of farmers and home builders for freeing up their lives, restoring their dignity, and allowing their businesses to grow. Reopening the energy industry promoted remarkable nationwide growth and allowed the United States to compete on the world stage, to the detriment of our enemies. 

While delivering economic blows to our foreign foes in China, Russia, and Iran, Trump also improved relations with our allies. He moved the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to the capital city of Jerusalem. He bolstered our own military, backed law enforcement, and sought to protect the country by restricting illegal immigration on the southern border through the construction of a wall and the ending of Obama-era catch-and-release policies.

Trump's America first policies turned the country around, setting it in a path back to greatness while sowing the seeds of patriotism once again in Americans.

I am a legal immigrant from Latin America and I am fighting hard to prevent the same destructive socialist policies which damaged our neighbors in South America from coming to the United States.

We must not allow the Democrats to defund the police. We must support our veterans and give them more, better choices in healthcare services. We must embrace school choice from the federal level and encourage competition in curricula. We must balance our budget and focus on reducing inflation by reducing government spending and printing. We must secure our border and introduce immigration reform that fits the modern era. We must reduce foreign influence on and acquisition of US single family housing and agricultural land. We must uphold free speech and ensure that every American has the right to share their opinions on public platforms.

My Republican primary opponent lost this district by 50 points to the Democrats in 2022 and performed 5% worse than prior Republicans in this district. I'm prepared to fight to increase our margins and turn this blue district purple. Democrats have lost over 31,000 registered voters since the 2022 election cycle, and over 69% of voters say they are willing to vote for someone across party lines in the general.

I would be honored to earn your vote in the July 30th primary and November 5th general elections. Never hesitate to reach out via DM!

God bless you and God bless America,

By donating, you’re standing with me and with our community to uphold the rule of law. Every dollar you contribute advances our mission to secure justice, fairness, and integrity in our courts. Please show your support for Justice Beyond Politics by attending our event on September 5.

I’ve been a Texas lawyer for over two decades - in private practice, I’ve worked across a broad spectrum of areas, including constitutional law, intellectual property, and corporate governance.

I’ve also served in all three branches of government, and my experience includes roles as Assistant Solicitor General, Special Counsel to the US Senate Judiciary Committee, and clerk to Judge Jerry Smith on the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Today, I lead a team of attorneys in the Texas Attorney General’s office, where I handle key cases such as challenges against the federal government on immigration issues.

As a fifth-generation Texan, I’m deeply committed to our state and the rule of law. I’ve written extensively on this subject and have led community education programs across Harris County, focusing on how to evaluate judicial candidates. I believe judges must be independent and impartial, deciding cases based on the law and facts to ensure the rule of law benefits all citizens. As a judge, I’m committed to upholding Justice Beyond Politics.

Our campaign is building momentum, but we need your voice, your vote, and your support to carry us to victory. Together, we can make a powerful impact—driven by our unwavering commitment to justice, liberty, and the rule of law. Let’s keep moving forward, united and determined to see this through.

The challenges at our border are overwhelming for our border patrol agents and dangerous for the families and children trying to cross. We can’t ignore the humanitarian crisis that’s unfolding, with vulnerable people falling prey to human traffickers.

I believe in a secure border because a nation without borders isn’t sovereign. We must ensure that those entering our country do so legally and safely. At the same time, we need thoughtful immigration reform that creates a pathway for families who want to contribute to our country, embrace the American Dream, and whose work is vital to our economy, while ensuring their safety and the safety of our citizens.

This isn’t just about immigration; it’s about protecting the people who call Arizona home. The challenges at our border are overwhelming for our border patrol agents and dangerous for the families and children trying to cross.

We can’t ignore the humanitarian crisis unfolding at our border, with vulnerable people falling prey to human traffickers. I believe in a secure border because a nation without borders isn’t sovereign.

We need thoughtful immigration reform that creates a legal pathway for families who want to contribute to our country and pursue the American Dream, while also ensuring their safety and the safety of our citizens.

Vote for me, Kylie Barber, and I’ll fight for a secure border and a stronger, safer Arizona.

Armenian voters in California's 32nd Congressional District often care about a mix of issues tied to their cultural heritage, community needs, and broader political concerns. I support their priorities, which include:

1. **Recognition of the Armenian Genocide**: This is a deeply important issue for many Armenian-Americans, and I advocate for genocide recognition and historical injustices.

2. **Support for Armenia and Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh)**: Given the complex geopolitics of the South Caucasus, Armenians often look for us to support U.S. foreign aid to Armenia and Artsakh, as well as those who speak out on regional security, especially in the context of conflict with Azerbaijan. I do support.

3. **Immigration and Family Reunification**: Many Armenian families have members abroad, so immigration policies that support family reunification and streamline the legal immigration process are of great interest to them. I support.

4. **Economic and Social Issues**: Like other neighbors, Armenian-Americans are concerned with local and national issues such as healthcare, education, affordable housing, and economic opportunities, especially in districts like California’s 32nd, which includes diverse communities. I am also concerned.

5. **Diaspora and Cultural Preservation**: I promote policies that help preserve the Armenian language, culture, and community institutions in the U.S.

6. **Legislation**:  I also endorse Adam Schiff's H.R.96666, which requires the President of the United States to seize Azerbaijani assets and create a process for Armenians displaced from Artsakh to claim such assets as compensation for lost revenue, and for other purposes.

1.37042E+15,111269970270606,MarkforMontana,2024-09-27,2024-09-27,2024-10-02,MarkforMontana,"Dear Neighbors:

In my long ago youth I had the honor and privilege to play football at the University of Georgia. The teams I played on were not as good as the Dawgs of today, but we were led by a Hall of Fame coach named Vince Dooley. That's me in the picture on the right (#56) helping carry Coach Dooley off the field in his last game (we beat Michigan State on January 1, 1989 in the Gator Bowl to finish the year ranked #15 at 9-3).

That was also my last competitive football game, but a lot of the lessons I learned still shape my life today. Also the memories I shared with my teammates are things I cherish, like the relationship I had with Bryant Gantt, who was hurt that game but is still carrying coach off the field (Bryant now works at UGA and you usually see him on the sideline when the Red and Black play on TV). In our house, we had a bit of a trip down memory lane a week ago on Gallatin High's ""College Gameday"" which was part of homecoming week - both of our kids decided to ""represent"" the Bulldogs. Was a bit of a proud moment for me because I usually get eyerolling from our teenagers for talking about the ""dinosaur days"".

Coach Dooley always taught us that ""a commitment is a commitment"", and when you give your word to someone you keep it. After marrying a Montana girl and proudly calling the Gallatin Valley our home for more than a decade, I know that maxim rings true here as well. So I'd like to share my commitment to the people in HD 63:

·    I firmly believe in the traditional Republican values of limited and small government. We need to find ways to reduce spending thus easing the tax burden crushing Montana families.

·    While many people, especially those in the media, get lost in memes of people in Ohio eating cats or dogs or gees, frankly I think that conversation is missing the point. Unchecked immigration is causing significant problems in this country (and other countries as well). The words written on the Statue of Liberty: ""Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"" embody an ideal worth preserving, but not at the expense of the rule of law. I believe we need not only to enforce the immigration laws in place, but also to work on reforming the immigration situation. It's a big issue, and Montanans should not have to bear the financial burden of people living in this country illegally.

·    Medicare expansion is a huge issue for the next legislative session, maybe the most important one of the upcoming session. Almost 100,000 Montanans rely on this program. We need to find a way to continue this program for those most at risk, and I will work hard to be part of the solution.

·    I do not believe the last election was stolen. It was a tough race, and Joe Biden was fairly elected as president. I want both of the current candidates to do a better job telling us what they will do instead of what the other candidate won't do. But, I do think that a person should have to validate or prove their citizenship before being allowed to register to vote - that's the law and it there should be safeguards to ensure it's enforced.

·    I believe that hatred, bigotry and division have no place in politics or governing. As it says in our pledge, we are ""one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all"". To me those are not just words, they are ideals. If elected I would work to make sure those values are reflected in our laws and how we govern.

·    I believe that the right to choose should be protected for women. That right exists in Montana's constitution, and it must remain protected. That doesn't mean I want people to have abortions. However, I believe that decision should be made by the woman who is pregnant.

I believe that I'm the best candidate for HD 63. I care about this community. I live in this district. Our kids go to school in this district. I'm asking for your vote to represent you and your family, guided by these commonsense principles I've laid out. If you agree with some, most or even all of my views I'd appreciate your support.

1️⃣ ""America Last"" Agenda: Kamala Harris has prioritized illegal immigrants over American citizens. Countless criminals including people on the terror watchlist have been released into the U.S. instead of being detained and deported.

2️⃣ Refusal to Lead: Despite being appointed to manage the border crisis, Harris ""resisted taking ownership of immigration,"" according to Politico. Her refusal to visit the southern border exemplifies her lack of accountability.

3️⃣ Endorses Radical Changes: Harris advocated for decreasing ICE funding.

4️⃣ Aiding Criminals: Harris’ stance on immigration has emboldened criminal illegal immigrants. In Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, violent crimes have surged, directly tied to the policies she supports.

5️⃣ False Promises, Real Consequences: Harris has promised ""orderly and humane"" immigration, but the reality is a surge in crime, poverty, and despair. Her rhetoric is hollow, with real Americans paying the price.

America Deserves Better Than Kamala Harris’ Failed Policies.

It has been a pleasure working alongside you over the years, and I look forward to continuing our work together in the future.

Zaida's Words:
""I’ve known Ruth for over 15 years. We have served on local non-profit boards and/or committees that address the needs of Hispanics. I’m proud to support Ruth because of her unwavering dedication to our community as a whole; regardless of race, religion, or political affiliation. Ruth has consistently fought for better access to quality education, affordable healthcare, and economic opportunities for all, while also standing strong for immigration reform that respects the dignity and contributions of immigrants. Her commitment to ensuring that everyone’s voice is heard and represented makes her the leader we need to help build a more inclusive and equitable future. We deserve a leader who understands us, as a community, and will work tirelessly for our families.""

Thank you, Zaida, for your kind words and unwavering support! 🙏 Together, we can build a stronger, more inclusive Delaware. 💙

This Election is NOT just Trump vs Harris… This election determines if the current Administration will continue to run our country.
--Can Vice President Harris change her existing Administration?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6suxE2lA0M

The State of our economy is the result of actions by the current Administration. National debt increased about $10T during the Obama's 8 yrs, $4T during Trump's 4 yrs (primarily due to Covid), and so far $7T under her Administration (Primarily due to the ""Green New Deal"" hidden in the Inflation Reduction Act and Illegal Immigration).
--Do we want 4 more years? 
https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/national-debt/#the-growing-national-debt

The total number of Illegal/undocumented Immigrants doubled, increasing by 11 million, during this Administration. The costs to taxpayers will continue for many years.
--Why can't we close our borders and only allow immigrants though our legal entry points?
https://usafacts.org/articles/what-can-the-data-tell-us-about-unauthorized-immigration/

The discussion on Abortion rarely addresses the Rights of the Unborn.  Roe v Wade gave the decision to abortion totally to the Mother. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, it opened the door for States to set rules. 
--What are the Rights of the Unborn relative to the  Mother's rights?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade

The key to our future is Energy. Wind and Solar depend on Mother Nature. This Administration tried to install a commercial ""small nuclear reactor"" on Eielson AFB in Aug 2023. They used a 47% owned Chinese company, but our DLA canceled the effort.
--Can we use our Navy's proven technology and acquisition processes to meet our Energy needs?  Maybe Elon Musk could make it happen!!

Arizona’s proximity to the southern border makes us a frontline state in the fight against these threats, and we must take decisive action to ensure the safety of our families and our state.

Here’s what Vic and Skyla will do:

- Stop the flow of illegal drugs, including fentanyl, by increasing law enforcement resources and working with federal agencies to intercept dangerous substances before they reach our streets.
- Combat human trafficking, which has become a serious issue, particularly affecting women and children. We’ll ensure law enforcement has the tools they need to disrupt trafficking networks and support victims in rebuilding their lives.
- Reinforce border security by investing in modern technology, physical barriers where necessary, and additional personnel to keep our border safe.
- Enforce our immigration laws fairly and strongly, ensuring that those who enter our country do so legally and responsibly, while protecting the rights of legal immigrants.
- Protect Arizona’s resources by ensuring taxpayer dollars are spent wisely, prioritizing Arizona citizens and legal residents.

LD26 is struggling with crime, poverty, and drugs—and securing the border is a crucial step in addressing these issues head-on. Vic and Skyla are fighting for a stronger, safer Arizona.

🗳️ Vote for Victor Harris for State Senate and Skyla Edwards for State House on or before November 5th. Together, we will secure our border and protect our communities.

His inability to effectively address the state's pressing concerns has led to negative consequences, undermining the well-being of the community and compromising Maine's future prosperity.
Learn More: www.windhamgop.com/windham-s-failed-leadership

- **Opposition to Senior Property Tax Relief**: Nangle opposed measures aimed at providing property tax relief for seniors. This position has been criticized for neglecting the financial needs of elderly residents who are struggling with increased living costs, highlighting a lack of leadership in addressing the concerns of vulnerable populations ([Maine Legislature Records](https://legislature.maine.gov/records/senate-record), [Maine Public](https://www.mainepublic.org/politics/2023-07-03/lawmakers-to-vote-on-900m-spending-bill-that-replaces-senior-tax-freeze-program)).

- **Support for Lenient Immigration Policies**: Nangle has supported far-left policies that provide access to a wide variety of state services for undocumented immigrants, reflecting a lenient approach that incentivizes illegal immigration. This policy stance has been viewed as reckless and as a failure to prioritize public resources for legal residents ([Maine Legislature Bill Information](https://legislature.maine.gov/legis/bills)). 

- **Promotion of Costly Green Energy Initiatives**: Nangle has championed green energy initiatives that place a significant financial burden on taxpayers while disproportionately benefiting select industries. His extreme far-left approach has been labeled as economically reckless, with inadequate consideration of the broader impact on Maine residents' energy costs and financial stability ([Maine Legislature Green Energy Votes](https://legislature.maine.gov/legis/bills), [Maine Public](www.mainepublic.org/politics/2023-07-07/after-intense-debate-and-lobbying-lawmakers-approve-tweaks-to-solar-subsidies)).

- **Support for Gender-Affirming Care for Minors**: Senator Nangle endorsed bills which mandate that MaineCare provide coverage for gender-affirming care, including treatments for gender dysphoria. This promotes irreversible medical procedures for minors without adequate safeguards, reflecting a reckless approach to sensitive healthcare issues ([Maine Legislature PDF](https://legislature.maine.gov/legis/bills/getPDF.asp?paper=HP0676&item=1&snum=131)).

- **Backing Full-Term Abortion Policies**: Nangle has supported legislation that allows abortions up to the point of birth, removes the criminal penalties for performing an abortion without being licensed as a medical professional, and for performing an abortion after viability of the fetus when it is not necessary for the preservation of the life or health of the mother. This stance has been criticized for undermining protections for unborn children, showcasing failed leadership on critical ethical issues ([Maine Legislature Statutes](https://legislature.maine.gov/statutes/22/title22sec1598.html), [Title 22, §1598: Abortions](https://legislature.maine.gov/statutes/22/title22sec1598.html), [131st Maine Legislature](getPDF.asp (maine.gov)).",,www.windhamgop.com,,"lower_bound: 0, upper_bound: 999","lower_bound: 0, upper_bound: 99",USD,"{""age"":""18-24"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.01105},{""age"":""18-24"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.027624},{""age"":""25-34"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.044199},{""age"":""25-34"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.198895},{""age"":""35-44"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.088398},{""age"":""35-44"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.348066},{""age"":""45-54"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.077348},{""age"":""45-54"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.20442}","{""region"":""Maine"",""percentage"":1}","facebook,instagram","lower_bound: 50001, upper_bound: 100000",en,2024-10-13,2024-10-13,2024-10-14,0.226519

- **Opposition to Senior Property Tax Relief**: Nangle opposed measures aimed at providing property tax relief for seniors. This position has been criticized for neglecting the financial needs of elderly residents who are struggling with increased living costs, highlighting a lack of leadership in addressing the concerns of vulnerable populations ([Maine Legislature Records](https://legislature.maine.gov/records/senate-record), [Maine Public](https://www.mainepublic.org/politics/2023-07-03/lawmakers-to-vote-on-900m-spending-bill-that-replaces-senior-tax-freeze-program)).

- **Support for Lenient Immigration Policies**: Nangle has supported far-left policies that provide access to a wide variety of state services for undocumented immigrants, reflecting a lenient approach that incentivizes illegal immigration. This policy stance has been viewed as reckless and as a failure to prioritize public resources for legal residents ([Maine Legislature Bill Information](https://legislature.maine.gov/legis/bills)). 

- **Promotion of Costly Green Energy Initiatives**: Nangle has championed green energy initiatives that place a significant financial burden on taxpayers while disproportionately benefiting select industries. His extreme far-left approach has been labeled as economically reckless, with inadequate consideration of the broader impact on Maine residents' energy costs and financial stability ([Maine Legislature Green Energy Votes](https://legislature.maine.gov/legis/bills), [Maine Public](www.mainepublic.org/politics/2023-07-07/after-intense-debate-and-lobbying-lawmakers-approve-tweaks-to-solar-subsidies)).

- **Support for Gender-Affirming Care for Minors**: Senator Nangle endorsed bills which mandate that MaineCare provide coverage for gender-affirming care, including treatments for gender dysphoria. This promotes irreversible medical procedures for minors without adequate safeguards, reflecting a reckless approach to sensitive healthcare issues ([Maine Legislature PDF](https://legislature.maine.gov/legis/bills/getPDF.asp?paper=HP0676&item=1&snum=131)).

- **Backing Full-Term Abortion Policies**: Nangle has supported legislation that allows abortions up to the point of birth, removes the criminal penalties for performing an abortion without being licensed as a medical professional, and for performing an abortion after viability of the fetus when it is not necessary for the preservation of the life or health of the mother. This stance has been criticized for undermining protections for unborn children, showcasing failed leadership on critical ethical issues ([Maine Legislature Statutes](https://legislature.maine.gov/statutes/22/title22sec1598.html), [Title 22, §1598: Abortions](https://legislature.maine.gov/statutes/22/title22sec1598.html), [131st Maine Legislature](getPDF.asp (maine.gov)).",,www.windhamgop.com,,"lower_bound: 2000, upper_bound: 2999","lower_bound: 0, upper_bound: 99",USD,"{""age"":""18-24"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.020408},{""age"":""18-24"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.060606},{""age"":""18-24"",""gender"":""unknown"",""percentage"":0.003711},{""age"":""25-34"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.057514},{""age"":""25-34"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.2047},{""age"":""25-34"",""gender"":""unknown"",""percentage"":0.002474},{""age"":""35-44"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.099567},{""age"":""35-44"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.322202},{""age"":""35-44"",""gender"":""unknown"",""percentage"":0.004947},{""age"":""45-54"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.054422},{""age"":""45-54"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.167594},{""age"":""45-54"",""gender"":""unknown"",""percentage"":0.001855}","{""region"":""Maine"",""percentage"":1}","facebook,instagram","lower_bound: 50001, upper_bound: 100000",en,2024-10-14,2024-10-14,2024-11-05,0.265306
