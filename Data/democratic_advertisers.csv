1.05964E+15,685932521559148,Representative Frank Burns,2024-10-27,2024-10-27,2024-11-03,Committee to Re-Elect Representative Frank Burns-,"MEDIA ENDORSEMENT: Any day now, look for the Tribune-Democrat to publish an 72nd Legislative District endorsement editorial that won’t be fair, balanced or historically accurate – but will reflect the newspaper’s strong and palpable bias against me.

I predict the $340 million in grants I’ve brought back or overseen will be given short shrift, even though there’s bountiful evidence of my personal, hands-on involvement, including numerous quotes from the grant recipients themselves.
I predict no praise for my consistent (and easily verifiable) votes in Harrisburg to never raise taxes; support the Second Amendment, law enforcement, veterans and seniors; and hold child molesters accountable.

There will be little or no mention of my American Made Jobs plan legislation, my success in obtaining Keystone Opportunity Zones to aid economic development, my rock-solid stances against sanctuary cities and illegal immigration, or any of the deciding votes I cast against my party leadership because what they wanted wasn’t good for the people of Cambria County.

And there won’t be any praise for the role I played in outing Vision 2025’s secret Human Capital Plan to recruit 100 Afghan refugee families to take jobs in and repopulate Cambria County. Nor will there be any mention that my opponent was a key member of Vision’s board of directors when that plan was masterminded, put on the launch pad and aimed at a public that was purposely being kept in the dark.

The Tribune-Democrat’s never delved into my opponent’s deep and abiding involvement with the Human Capital Plan, and its projected negative impact on our schools, taxes, social and medical services, law enforcement resources, and Section 8 public housing. Don’t look for them to hold her accountable now.

Instead, look for the newspaper to sharpen its pen to levy its biggest editorial attack on me to date.  That’s the price you pay for pointing out – as I did – that then-publisher Robert Forcey should step down from Vision’s board of directors (where he served alongside my opponent) as a conflict of interest. Forcey later skedaddled for a job as Vision’s executive director, which tells you all you need to know about the validity of my point.

That’s but one of the reasons I gave up talking to the Tribune-Democrat. Another is that the newspaper was nowhere to be found in 2018, 2020 and 2022, as an escalating barrage of negative and record-distorting mail pieces funded by the PHILADELPHIA BILLIONAIRE backed Commonwealth Leaders Fund that were being used to aid my opponents in a concerted attempt to defeat me.

This year, the Tribune-Democrat miraculously found campaign advertising worthy of news coverage – but it wasn’t the 30-plus, Commonwealth Leaders Fund mailings attacking me and designed to once again benefit my opponent. Even though the newspaper in January editorially asked, “Who’s paying for those anti-Burns ads and mailers?” it hasn’t tallied or reported on the millions that these out-of-towners have spent on mail and TV advertising, to once again try to buy an election in Cambria County for their hand-picked candidate.

Instead, they’ve devoted reportage to one ad – a truthful one my campaign has done, regarding my opponent’s public relations role in selling the sale of Conemaugh Hospital, and her rosy prediction that it would be “great news for patients.” She’s on tape saying it.

While my opponent’s good-sounding public relations words didn’t come true, in 2022 I used my vote to ensure that Conemaugh Memorial Medical Center received $3 million in state funding to replenish resources and fund recruitment and staff retention efforts. Judge for yourself which of us did the more positive thing for health care and the community.

I’m sure none of this will be mentioned by the Tribune-Democrat. So, I’m counting on you, the people, the ones I’ve known for years, the ones I’ve met this year by knocking on thousands of doors, the ones who know what good I’ve done (and what bad I’ve stopped in its tracks), to return me to office as the tested, faithful public servant who will always put YOUR interests first.

I’ve never forgotten where I came from, how I was raised, or who I represent. And you have my promise that I never will. I'm one of you, not one of them.

Sincerely
Frank Burns",,,,"lower_bound: 5000, upper_bound: 5999","lower_bound: 0, upper_bound: 99",USD,"{""age"":""18-24"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.27019},{""age"":""45-54"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.036786},{""age"":""65+"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.066385},{""age"":""65+"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.078647},{""age"":""55-64"",""gender"":""unknown"",""percentage"":0.001268},{""age"":""55-64"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.036364},{""age"":""55-64"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.038055},{""age"":""45-54"",""gender"":""unknown"",""percentage"":0.000846},{""age"":""45-54"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.025793},{""age"":""18-24"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.245243},{""age"":""35-44"",""gender"":""unknown"",""percentage"":0.002114},{""age"":""35-44"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.038055},{""age"":""35-44"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.023679},{""age"":""25-34"",""gender"":""unknown"",""percentage"":0.002537},{""age"":""25-34"",""gender"":""male"",""percentage"":0.072727},{""age"":""25-34"",""gender"":""female"",""percentage"":0.053277},{""age"":""18-24"",""gender"":""unknown"",""percentage"":0.007188},{""age"":""65+"",""gender"":""unknown"",""percentage"":0.000846}","{""region"":""Maryland"",""percentage"":0.142552},{""region"":""Pennsylvania"",""percentage"":0.846351},{""region"":""West Virginia"",""percentage"":0.011097}","facebook,instagram","lower_bound: 50001, upper_bound: 100000",en,2024-10-27,2024-10-27,2024-11-03,0.31797
